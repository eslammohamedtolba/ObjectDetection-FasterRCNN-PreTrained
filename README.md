# Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

This repository contains a Flask web application that performs object detection using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model. 
The model is capable of detecting objects from the COCO dataset, and the application allows users to upload images and view the detected objects along with their labels and confidence scores.
